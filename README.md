## Grammars

The first grammar that I created was based on Psalm 71:22. It was a Sunday and I thought it fitting, considering where I live (Alabama).

### Haikus

I decided that the first set of experiments that I wanted to conduct involved expressing Haikus as grammars. I started with a haiku:

Awake we can't see
dreams are custom messages.
Nighttime is coming.

I developed a very rough draft for the song using a [psy-trance sound pack](https://share.reasonstudios.com/pack/347) from Reason studios. You can listen to the first cut on [my Soundcloud page](https://soundcloud.com/cerkit-music).

[Dreams are custom messages](https://soundcloud.com/cerkit-music/dreams-are-custom-messages-psytrance-trance-130-bpm)

You can view the grammar in the Poetry/Haiku folder.
