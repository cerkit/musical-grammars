## Grammars

I wrote a song for the first grammar that I created.

[No harp to play on, will this do?](https://cerkit.bandcamp.com/track/no-harp-to-play-on-will-this-do)

You can read more about that process on my blog.

### Haikus

I decided that the first set of experiments that I wanted to conduct involved expressing Haikus as grammars. I started with a haiku:

Awake we can't see<br>
dreams are custom messages.<br>
Nighttime is coming.<br>

I developed a very rough draft for the song using a [psy-trance sound pack](https://share.reasonstudios.com/pack/347) from Reason studios. You can listen to the first cut on [my Soundcloud page](https://soundcloud.com/cerkit-music).

[Dreams are custom messages](https://soundcloud.com/cerkit-music/dreams-are-custom-messages-psytrance-trance-130-bpm)

You can view the grammar in the Poetry/Haiku folder.
